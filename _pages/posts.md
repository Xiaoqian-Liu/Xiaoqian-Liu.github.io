# Stats/ML tutorials

I started a series of Stats/ML tutorials at our lab meeting to discuss some topics in statistics and machine learning that are commonly seen in biological applications. My goal is to give a presentation of each topic at a high level and also discuss practical considerations for using the involved methods. In general, the target readers are students without strong Stats/ML background but with some experience in using these methods.

While I try to carefully prepare these materials, I might make mistakes. Please feel free to reach out if you spot an error or a doubtful statement.
