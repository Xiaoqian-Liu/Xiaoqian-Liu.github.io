# *Knowledge is everywhere. Let's share!* 

While I try to carefully prepare all materials, I might make mistakes. Please feel free to reach out if you spot an error or a doubtful statement in my posts. 

# Stats/ML tutorials

These materials were developed when I worked at MD Anderson. The goal was to discuss at a high level some topics in statistics and machine learning that are commonly seen in biological applications. The target audience are students without strong Stats/ML background but with some experience in using these methods.
