title: "About me "
---

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, advised by Prof. [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/). Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Bo Zhang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/teacher_more.php?cid=89248&id=52). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology. 

During my PhD studies, I was very pleased to work with Prof. [Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home), Prof. [David Papp](https://dpapp.math.ncsu.edu/), Prof. [Aaron J. Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/) and Prof. [Amanda Randles](https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu/people/amanda-randles) on a diverse set of projects. In 2021, I had a wonderful summer at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans) as a Wallace Givens Associate, working on a research project on derivative-free optimization under the supervision of Dr. [Stefan M. Wild](https://wildsm.github.io/). I will continue working with Dr. Stefan M. Wild as a Research Aide in Fall 2021.
