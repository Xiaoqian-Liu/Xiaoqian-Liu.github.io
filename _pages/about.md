title: "About me "
---

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). I am also a faculty member of the UCR Graduate Program in [Genetics, Genomics & Bioinformatics](https://genetics.ucr.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/), working with Dr. [Wenyi Wang](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/) from 2022 to 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from [North Carolina State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) in 2022, advised by Dr. [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/) (now at Rice University). 

My research interests broadly lie in statistical machine learning, computational statistics & optimization, and their applications in bioinformatics & cancer biology. Some key words of my research: penalization methods, structure recovery, robust estimation, majorization-minimization principle, high-dimensional data analysis, genetic variant annotation, transcriptome deconvolution, tumor heterogeneity and evolution.

I am actively looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to work on 1) method and algorithm development in statistics and machine learning and/or 2) applications in cancer biology. Please feel free to send me an email with your CV if you are interested.
