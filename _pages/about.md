title: "About me "
---

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, advised by Professor [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/). Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China. Prior to that, I graduated from China University of Mining and Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. In 2021, I had a wonderful summer at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans) as a Wallace Givens Associate, working on a research project on derivative-free optimization under the supervision of [Dr. Stefan Wild](https://wildsm.github.io/). I will continue working with Dr. Wild as Research Assistant in Fall 2021.
