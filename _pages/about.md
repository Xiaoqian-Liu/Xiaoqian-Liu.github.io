I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, advised by Professor [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/). Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China.
