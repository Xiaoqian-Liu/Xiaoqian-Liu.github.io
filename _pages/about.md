I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, advised by Professor [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/).

My research interests include numerical optimization, convex analysis, non-convex regularization and their applications in statistical learning.
