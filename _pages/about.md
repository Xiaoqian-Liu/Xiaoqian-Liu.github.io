title: "About me "
---

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/), working with Dr. [Wenyi Wang](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/) from 2022 to 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from [North Carolina State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) in 2022, advised by Dr. [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/) (now at Rice University). 

My research interests broadly lie in statistical machine learning, computational statistics & optimization, and their applications in bioinformatics & cancer biology.

[//]: # I am broadly interested in numerical optimization, machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, and their applications in cancer omics data analysis, including genomic diversity and transcriptomic heterogeneity. 


[//]: #Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Bo Zhang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/teacher_more.php?cid=89248&id=52). 
[//]: #Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology. 

[//]: #Since my PhD studies, I have had great pleasure in working with Prof. [Kenneth L. Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702), Prof. [Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/
[//]: #Nadler/home), Prof. [Shiqian Ma](https://sqma.rice.edu/), Prof. [Aaron J. Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/), and Prof. [Amanda Randles](https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu/people/amanda-randles) on a diverse set of projects. 
[//]: #From Summer 2021 to Summer 2022, I had a wonderful internship at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans), working on a research project on derivative-free optimization under the supervision of 
[//]: #Dr. [Stefan M. Wild](https://wildsm.github.io/) (now at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab). 

Outside of research, I love brisk walking, fitness classes, and yoga (particularly hot yoga). I am proud of being a yogi! You never know what persistence will pay off!  

I am actively looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to work on 1) method and algorithm development in statistics and machine learning and/or 2) applications in cancer biology. Feel free to send me an email with your CV if you are interested.
