title: "About me "
---

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University, advised by Prof. [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/). Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. Bo Zhang. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology. 

During my PhD studies, I was pleased to work as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Eric C. Chi and Prof. [Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home) from Weizmann Institute  of Science on particular projects. In 2021, I had a wonderful summer at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans) as a Wallace Givens Associate, working on a research project on derivative-free optimization under the supervision of Dr. [Stefan M. Wild](https://wildsm.github.io/). I will continue working with Dr. Stefan M. Wild as a Research Aide in Fall 2021.
