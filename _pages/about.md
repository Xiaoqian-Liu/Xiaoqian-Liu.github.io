title: "About me "
---

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas MD Anderson  Cancer Center, working with Prof. [Wenyi Wang](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/). 
I received my PhD degree in Statistics from [North Carolina State University](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) in 2022, advised by Prof. [Eric C. Chi](http://www.ericchi.com/)(currently at Rice). 
[//]: # Before joining NCSU, I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Bo Zhang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/teacher_more.php?cid=89248&id=52). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from China University of Mining and Technology. 

During my PhD studies, I was very pleased to work with Prof. [Kenneth L. Lange](https://people.healthsciences.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel_id=45702) ,  Prof. [Boaz Nadler](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home), Prof. [Aaron J. Molstad](https://ajmolstad.github.io/) and Prof. [Amanda Randles](https://randleslab.pratt.duke.edu/people/amanda-randles) on a diverse set of projects. From Summer 2021 to Summer 2022, I had a wonderful internship at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans), working on a research project on derivative-free optimization under the supervision of Dr. [Stefan M. Wild](https://wildsm.github.io/) (currently at Berkeley Lab).
